      <p>
After reaching record highs in 2018 and 2019, Texas has seen a drastic decrease in the state’s production of natural gas.       </p>
      <p data-dummytext="">
        At the beginning of 2020, Texas was the highest producer of natural gas in the world. Production increased by 1.27 trillion cubic feet in 2019. This was nearly 20% more than previous years. The state was able to jump even higher than Pennsylvania, which sits as the United State’s second-highest natural gas producer.

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>
        However, it was this record breaking production that set Texas up to have lower rates in the years to follow. Higher production rates allowed for natural gas in storage to increase. This meant that there was less of a demand for newly produced resources.

        Along with this previous production boom, other factors contributed to these low numbers. 2019 saw one of the warmest winters on record. This decreased the amount of gas utilized by consumers, which also helped increase the previously mentioned storage numbers.

      <h4>Effects of COVID-19</h4>

       <div class="main-text">
      <p>
Weather was not the only contributor however. The COVID-19 pandemic had a great influence on natural gas production, with impacts that experts predict will carry into the rest of 2021.      </p>
      <p data-dummytext="">
        COVID-19 also significantly decreased the demand for natural gas. Consumers, both residential and commercial, found everyday operations greatly disrupted by the outbreak. This meant that consumers did not require as much natural gas as previous years, as they were not operating their daily lives and business days the same way.

While this trend did carry into 2021, experts predict that this trend will be short-lived      </p>
      <p data-dummytext="">
        As life returns to normal, people’s gas consumption is also expected to return to previous behaviors as well. Additionally, while past year’s higher rates had an impact on demand, these low rates can expect to have similar impacts. With a decrease in production, 2022 can expect to see much higher rates in order to recover from these last two years.
